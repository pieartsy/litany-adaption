I understand the desire to use other text when working on a project. I understand that we live in a time of mash-ups, cover songs, and remixes. To be honest, though, your adaptation of my poem makes me very sad. The idea that it could be a fun project for you or an item on your portfolio is actually very insulting. Why would you animate this poem? I could have made the poem interactive but I chose not to.&nbsp;The whimsy and light-heartedness of the approach turns whatever subtlety and sincerity the poem might have had into a joke. Why not use your own text? Why not use someone else's text that would fit the tone of the form?</div><div><br></div><div>Please cease and desist. You do not have permission to share or publish this poem or any of my poems, whether adapted by you or unadulterated. Messing with someone's writing or art is rarely going to turn out well. Especially since they chose their venue and their form. Doing what they already decided not to do is a strange thing to celebrate. If your intent is satire--political or cultural--then there are many who do exactly this, with the intent to provoke or incite. The materials they use are usually large cultural texts or events--a presidential address, a blockbuster movie, a hit song--and not little independent heartfelt things like poems. Consider or reconsider your intent. At least you bought the book and retyped the poem by hand, instead of just cutting and pasting from the internet as if everyone's artistic efforts were just opportunities for fun projects and resumé building.</div><div><br></div><div>If I wanted the words to move, I would have done something like this:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xZALSxaLVM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xZALSxaLVM</a></div><div><br></div><div>Yours,</div><div>Richard</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_attr">On Mon, Mar 4, 2019 at 6:09 PM maddie.violets &lt;<a href="mailto:maddie.violets@gmail.com" target="_blank">maddie.violets@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-style:solid;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex"><div><div>Hello!</div><div><br></div><div>I'm Maddie, and I love Litany in Which Certain Things Are Crossed Out a heckuva lot! I am an interactive fiction developer and I like to work in Twine (more info abt twine: <a href="http://twinery.org/" target="_blank">http://twinery.org/</a> ).

It has credit to you of course, and a link to the poem on poetry foundation!</div><div><br></div><div>But even if you don't feel like looking at it, I am sending this email to ask if you'd grant permission for me to spread it around and such, more publically than just between myself and my friends. This would not be for money at all, of course - I would just put a link up online for free. If I could put the adaption into things like my portfolio as well, that'd be very awesome!</div><div><br></div><div>Let me know!</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>Maddie</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div id="gmail-m_3234208726481826526gmail-m_671793997301354720composer_signature"><div style="font-size:85%;color:rgb(87,87,87)" dir="auto">Sent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone</div></div></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>cc'd to: Marika Lysandrou, Yale University Press
